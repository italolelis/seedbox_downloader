# Requirements: Seedbox Downloader v1.3

**Defined:** 2026-02-08
**Core Value:** Show in-progress downloads in Sonarr/Radarr Activity tab via the Transmission RPC proxy.

## v1.3 Requirements

Requirements for Activity Tab Support milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Core: In-Progress Visibility

- [x] **ACTIVITY-01**: Return downloading/queued transfers in torrent-get response (remove FileID==0 filter)
- [x] **ACTIVITY-02**: Use SaveParentID for label matching on in-progress transfers (FileID unavailable during download)
- [x] **ACTIVITY-03**: Conditional file population -- only populate Files array when FileID!=0 (completed transfers)
- [x] **ACTIVITY-04**: Double safety net via IsAvailable()+IsDownloadable() prevents download pipeline from processing in-progress transfers

### Enhanced: Status, Peers, Labels

- [x] **ACTIVITY-05**: Map Put.io PeersConnected, PeersSendingToUs, PeersGettingFromUs, DownloadSpeed to TransmissionTorrent response fields (peersConnected, peersSendingToUs, peersGettingFromUs, rateDownload)
- [x] **ACTIVITY-06**: Map all Put.io statuses: in_queue/waiting -> StatusDownloadWait(3), finishing/checking -> StatusCheck(2), error -> StatusStopped(0) with ErrorString populated. Add warn-log for unknown statuses.
- [x] **ACTIVITY-07**: Add Labels []string to TransmissionTorrent struct, populate with configured label from proxy configuration

## Deferred (v2+)

Explicitly deferred based on research. Not needed for Activity tab MVP.

- **Response caching** -- Only add if rate limit issues surface in production (monitor first)
- **secondsDownloading / secondsSeeding** -- Put.io does not natively track these durations
- **isStalled detection** -- Requires progress tracking state over time
- **uploadedEver** -- Requires Put.io upload byte tracking verification
- **Multi-instance labels filtering** -- Verify Sonarr actually uses labels for category filtering

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Response caching layer | Monitor-first approach; defer until rate limits observed |
| New API endpoints | Activity tab uses existing torrent-get |
| Database schema changes | No state persistence needed for in-progress display |
| New dependencies | Existing go-putio SDK has all required fields |
| Deluge client changes | Activity tab is Put.io specific |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| ACTIVITY-01 | Phase 12 | Complete |
| ACTIVITY-02 | Phase 11 | Complete |
| ACTIVITY-03 | Phase 12 | Complete |
| ACTIVITY-04 | Phase 12 | Complete |
| ACTIVITY-05 | Phase 12 | Complete |
| ACTIVITY-06 | Phase 12 | Complete |
| ACTIVITY-07 | Phase 12 | Complete |
